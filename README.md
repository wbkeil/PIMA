Pharmacy Inventory Management Application (Senior Capstone)

I made this as my senior capstone project. I developed it with the intention of having it used to track expiring medications
and lot numbers by allowing the user to scan the barcode on an item (or enter an NDC manually) and then entering in the
optional field what data they'd like to track. I worked in a pharmacy for 7+ years and would have loved something like
this to easily generate a list of expiring items I could then query later. The SQLite or CSV export would ideally be used
with a DBMS for easy generation of relevant data.
